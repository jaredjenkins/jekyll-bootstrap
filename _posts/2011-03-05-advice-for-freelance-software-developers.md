title: A Word of Advice for Freelance Software Developers
---
Before I started working as a full-time consultant at my current job, I spent a lot of time writing code to pay bills and to enhance my lifestyle in high school and college. Freelance code writing can be a great experience, but it can also drive you to kill. All of my projects start off well, with the best intentions:

*   You look at the current solution.
*   You laugh at how poorly done it is.
*   You promise to deliver something that blows it out of the water.

In the best case, you do just that and everything goes well. And then there are the terrible client experiences ...

They seem like an awful relationship that just won't end; when the project is over you walk away with a bad taste in your mouth and wonder where everything went wrong. Neither party is happy and life sucks. It's easy to feel as if the client was at fault for most of it. *After all you are the technologist and the expert. Nothing you do can go wrong.* I can remember feeling like this a lot, and man ... that was **stupid**.

In reality there are very basic things that I could have done to prevent this. If you start to follow these steps, you will hopefully mitigate these experiences and walk away from projects feeling satisfied and happy with the work you accomplishe

## Get to Know Your Client

### Understand the Problem

When you first meet with your client, have some questions in mind:

*   What is his end goal?
    *   If this answer seems flimsy, you can expect your time budget to will grow (sometimes by a factor of 2). It may be an
        early sign that you need to walk away before the project even starts.
*   How much is she willing to spend on this project?
    *   There is a reason you are being hired for this project and not an established web design firm: you are expected to be 
        cheaper. However, your client's idea of cheap may be vastly different than yours. You should also account for variability in the project time budget.
    *   If they feel that you might be getting under-compensated, be upfront about it or seek out alternative forms of
        compensation. For instance, value-added or equity ownership in the project might be a possibility.
*   If there is already a current solution to this problem, what don't you like about it?
    *   This is something very easy to overlook. It's easy to say that the previous developer was a some schmuck who didn't
        know anything about software development or web design. In some cases, that can be very true - there are a lot of terrible coders out there. I have the sleepless nights to prove it. But sometimes, the client had a hand in this, too. Be careful, before you jump to conclusions.

### Gauge their Knowledge

In most cases, the entire reason you are being hired is because your client doesn't know how to accomplish the task in front of them. They know they need to use some piece of technology, whether it should be a web site, client application, or web service is probably over their head or not worth your time. They might believe they understand how a website or application works, and while that may be true, it's probably not the case. It's your job to figure this out.

## Know Your Limitations

As one of my all-time favorite action movie heroes Harry Callahan once said: *"A man's got to know his limitations."* This especially important in the world of freelance computer programming and web design.

As a freelance developer, I never wanted to say I couldn't do something. I wanted the client to have the utmost confidence in my abilities. Sometimes picking up a new skill is not hard on a project and it can actually be very beneficial. However, you have to be careful about this. Do some ground work to make sure this is something you can actually do without driving the project's time budget through the roof.

## Make a Plan

Once you have taken inventory of the client's expectations, you should take the time to plan out what you are going to do and how much time it will. In my experience, it's very easy to skip this step. Your client wants to get things done. You would rather start working on items that are actually billable. But this is a big mistake. No, its actually a HUGE mistake. A plan - even better yet a Statement of Work (SOW) - will save you hours of agony later. It's the best way to protect yourself from scope creep and a forseeable bad break up with your client at the end of the project.

Estimating time is by no means a cut and dry task. My best advice is to use your past experiences and to be liberal with items that are nebulous or require you to learn new technologies. Once you have the total hours put together, tack on additional 20 to 30 % to account for the unexpected changes and risks. This factor might be even larger for projects that carry more uncertainty.

## Key Takeaways

Get to know your client. Understand what they are trying to accomplish and decide whether you are the right person to help them accomplish this task. Realize that previous solutions were developed for a mix of reasons. Sometimes our egos get the best of us and we can draw conclusions too quickly about the work of developers who came before us. Try to avoid this tendency and be more open-minded; know that your client probably had some hand in the way things were created originally.

Ultimately, focus more on how you intend to improve the situation and less on the mistakes of the past.
Know what you can do and what you can't. And most importantly, think through your solution and develop a plan that both the client and you are comfortable with.

I hope this advice is helpful to freelance developers. Happy coding.
