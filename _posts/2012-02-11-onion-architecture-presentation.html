Over the past few months, I've been evaluating Onion Architecture for my employer West Monroe Partners. With a team of two other developers, I put together a proof-of-concept. While the demo will be kept internal, you can see the presentation <a href="http://jared-jenkins.com/onion_arch_presentation" target="newTab">here</a> on my blog. I'm hoping to flesh out my findings into some blog posts in the near future.
