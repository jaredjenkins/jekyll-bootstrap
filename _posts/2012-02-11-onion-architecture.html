            <p>
                "I'm advocating an approach where you're mindful of these design patterns but you keep them in the background. When you have working code that is starting to get messy, or when someone on your team has been banging their head on a problem for way too long, that's when you take out the patterns book. Because at that point you have a pretty good idea of what the problem actually is. You even have a solution that's mostly working and that solution can be re-factored to fit the pattern that seems most appropriate."

        <ul>
            <li>Architectures and design patterns should be more utilitarian than kantian in practice; they are just tools created to solve problems, they are not goods in themselves.</li>
            <li>We should use the right tool for the right job. This KTS is not about saying that N-Tier architecture is dead. It's about suggesting an alternative.</li>

                system unless you have a good understanding of what banking is all about, one must understand the <strong>domain</strong> of banking."

        <ul>
            <li>In order to create good software, you should ultimately understand the <strong>domain</strong> that the software will operate in and the problems that it is intended to solve. </li>
            <li>While Agile methodologies tell us that we need to avoid heavy upfront investment in the design of software, we do still need to care about some continuous model of the problem. Afterall this is core to the application - the problem you are trying to solve.</li>
            <li>However, developers frequently immerse themselves so deeply in the technical details of the implementation that they fail to recognize the true business problem/solution until it's too late. And key stakeholders in the business, don't speak code. Communication breakdown!</li>

        <h2>A Ubiquitous Language Leads to More Common Understanding</h2>
        <p>Domain-Driven Design is about getting developers and stakeholders to start talking in the same language so that the right problem can be solved, faster. Both in conversation and in code.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain Models</strong> are the core objects in your business logic. 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Entities</strong> are objects that have some <em>unique identity</em>, and <em>continuity</em> accross your application e.g. a Customer class.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value objects</strong> are shared objects in the system that do not need an identity. They should, however, be thin and immutable (no public write access, everything is set from the constructor once). 
                    e.g. The Customer's Address.</li>
                </ul>
            </li> 
            <li>
                <strong>Services</strong> are interfaces that act upon on an Entities. They exist for higher level operations that the Entity doesn't clearly own. <strong>Modules</strong> are facades that can hold many 
                different Services and can allow for more cohesive operations, with limited coupling.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repositories</strong> persist the state of your domain models. It's your connection to a SQL database, flatfile, or NoSQL database. They are built around <strong>Aggregates</strong> which define how your data is organized, i.e. if I delete 
                an Order does that not also delete all of its Order Line Items?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Factories</strong> coordinate complicated Entity creation processes. They exist only for when you are creating a <em>brand-new</em> Entity object but they are not always necessary.

        <h2>The Power of Inversion-Of-Control</h2>
        <div class="contentWrapper">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Inversion-of-control is a design pattern that promotes decoupled code by separating the repeatable code from the implementation specific logic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The factory pattern, dependency injection, and the service-locator pattern are three very common ways to use inversion-of-control.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Let's look at these one step at a time: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Let's look at the  <a onclick="view('concrete-classes')">concrete implementation</a> of a car and an engine.</li>
                <li>Using a <a onclick="view('factory-pattern')">factory pattern</a> we can start decoupling our code.</li>
            
                <li>Hmm, this factory pattern seems like a lot of code after while. <a onclick="view('dependency-injection')">dependency injection</a> is a little nicer.</li>
                <li>
                    Finally, the <a onclick="view('service-locator')">service-locator pattern</a>. The main thing to note here is that our Ferrari class has to know about the singleton ServiceLocator class.
                    I think the previous two are more preferred, but there are times when you can't use the other solutions.

        <h2>The Problem N-Tier Architecture is Attempting to Solve</h2>
        <p>
            I think we can all agree that separation of concerns through N-Tier architecture is a good idea at its core. 
            It's something that we care about as a practice and it tends to separate us from the capabilities of our clients.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Our business logic is agnostic of our database or data repository be it Oracle, SQL Server, flat files, web services - we shouldn't care.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our UI should only hold the bare minimum business logic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Large or changing teams should be able to understand our logic and keep it cohesive, because it is separated.
            </li>
            <li>
                And in theory, we should, at any point, be able to completely swap out one layer for the other - 
                change the database, change the UI, etc. We separated everything right?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>... and Where N-Tier Falls Short</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The attempted solution, repeated in many organizations, is to create a new layer in the architecture, 
                with the promise that this time, really and truly, no business logic will be put into the new layer. However, having no mechanism to detect when a violation of that promise occurs, the organization finds a few years later that the new layer is cluttered with business logic and the old problem has reappeared.
            </p>
            <cite>Alistair Cockburn</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's very common for us to start allowing our database objects into the UI layer. Even if we don't do that our 
                UI will depend on our DAL, because dependencies are <em>transitive</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Business logic becomes very easy to throw into your UI or DAL. This is not because we're lazy, sometimes we don't know any better.
            </li>
            <li>
                Over time, it can get hard to transition code between teams and have the same architecture stay consistent. This is 
                because N-Tier Architecture doesn't do a really good job of <em>communicating intent</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Because of all of this, you can't easily replace components - the solution has become highly coupled.

        <h2>Onion Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                The <strong>Domain</strong> layer defines your Entities that are at the core of your business logic.
                This project should not reference or contain anything but POCO - <em>Plain Old CLR Objects</em> - in it.
                In this project, you can define all of your APIs for your repository. 
                This project can also define models for communication purposes (DTOs, Models, etc) - however I'm not sure if this is always the best practice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Application/Domain Services</strong> help define the intent of your services. These services when implemented orchestrate calls to your repositories and return data to the client. 
                Some of these services, may even act as a facade for other services - it's up to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Infrastructure</strong> is where you actually implement everything that isn't part of your public facing API: 
                Repositories, Logging, Security, etc. It's at the last edge of your onion, so it can reference everything.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on what your application is doing a <strong>Client</strong> project may be implementing your services through UI, WCF Services, or both.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Depending Resolution</strong> project is in charge of binding almost of your code with the exception of Service specific to our Client code. This project can reference everything.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Tests</strong> project is for ... This project can and should reference everything.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            An important thing to note is that, while very common, an Dependency Injection/IoC Container is not necessary. Sometimes, it may be more desirable to use a ServiceLocator pattern 
            to handle the Inversion of Control logic in a large SOA - ask Jon Hansen, he's done this.

        <h2>Likes, Dislikes, and Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>What I liked about the Onion?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I really liked the promotion of Business Logic, because it's one of the things that I have tried to improve as a developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Loosely coupled code was a lot easier to think about as the layers of the Onion grew out. Interfaces kept us honest.
            </li>
            <li>
                We didn't realize it until the end, but the Onion architecture would have allowed us to prototype this applicaton very fast.
                We didn't necessarily need to invest a lot of time in writing all of this backend code upfront. The Inversion of Control container could just bind the mock objects for us.
            </li>
            <li>
                It works really well with WCF and MVC3.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I disliked about the Onion?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                As you can see we had to put a lot more upfront effort to get even our basic parts going. 
            </li>
            <li>
                This loosely coupled code is nice, but without knowing where things are, it can get annoying to trace references. 
                You press F12 and you're back at the interface ... Lame.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's hard to know how powerful/worth it this architecture is. What problems are we trying to solve? Data access dependencies seems to be the clearest, so maybe we just need to make a project called IDAL to accompany the DAL? 
            </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes trusting an interface can be hard. I have a story for this.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My overall opinion</h3>
        <p>
            My conclusion is that the Onion Architecture is suited well for large, complex projects where loosely-coupled code and cohesive design matters. It does a great of job promoting business logic,
            and I can see this working well with service focused designs like MVC3 or WCF.
