<h2>Consulting Bliss</h2>
I graduated from Northwestern University, and unlike many of the people in generation, I was lucky enough to have a job secured when I got my diploma. I was also going to work in consulting, a field that as an undergrad had been lauded as one of the best career opportunities for college graduates. For many it's the stepping stone into business, the best-paid break before graduate school, or the best way to not really know what you want to do, but still have a white-collar job. I had been passed up by the prestigious management consulting firms (brainteaser questions and case interviews were never my specialty), but I was going to work for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openbi.com">OpenBI</a>, LLC, a small Chicago-based open source business intelligence consultancy. I was excited to start my next chapter of life. I was immersed into the world of Linux, ROLAP, and Pentaho quickly, but ultimately found out quickly that I missed software development.

I left Open BI after a few months on a client, and joined <a target="_blank" href="http://www.westmonroepartners.com">West Monroe Partners</a>, LLC. WMP had a far larger staff and I would be able to work on custom software again. Although, I had had a few years of experience with .NET Framework and C# I immediately started learning new things, very quickly. If I had to isolate one positive thing about consulting and about my experience at WMP, it's that I learned an incredible amount very quickly early in my career. While a lot of my learning was very motivated by own curiosity and drive to get better at my trade, being a consultant affords you the opportunity to experiment, especially when you possess an intangible technical expertise - like software development. You are the <em>"expert"</em> and you are, in the majority of my experiences, given the free will to build solutions as you see fit. Your major constraint, of course, is your client's budget and time, but as we know in software those rarely end up as we expect.

<h2>The Honeymoon is Over</h2>
Within a year, I was working for a major client and helping to manage small teams and larger projects. By all standards, things at my job were going well: I'd been promoted. I'd gotten raises and bonuses for my hard work. I had a good circle of friends at work. Yet, I felt increasingly dissatisfied. I had picked up a CLR book and read it in my free time, hoping to glean a better understanding of how Microsoft's framework actually functioned. This earned me odd looks from people in the office. I was pushing the limits of many of my manager's technical knowledge, and felt that very few people could mentor or guide me; there just isn't time to do this in a leveraged business model. While I did work with some very technical people, many of my managers had become better salespeople than engineers. These people were not dumb, they were quite smart, but at a certain point their ability to be technical had stopped mattering. I quickly realized that in professional services it becomes less about what you can do, and more about how you can work with and sell to clients. I didn't enjoy sales and I wanted to keep growing technically. Advice from a former boss at a past internship echoed through my brain as I became increasingly disenfranchised, "If you want to keep fixing older code stay in Chicago, if you want to build new things, go to San Francisco." 

<h2>The Hunt Begins</h2>
For months, a friend had been tempting me to move to California; ironically he is originally from the Midwest, and I from California. His father is also, conveniently, a headhunter. I called him to discuss how I could move from Chicago to the San Francisco Bay Area. As our phone conversation continued, I started to aired my doubts whether this was the right move ... "Was I being too impulsive? How would this look on my resume?" ...  He retorted "Don't worry, Jared. You're going to make mistakes in your career ... If you want to move to SF, then go for it." He was right; in April of 2012, I finally bit and started my job hunt.  

I placed my resume on <a target="_blank" href="http://dice.com">Dice.com</a> and scanned <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/jobs" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> for jobs that I thought would be a good match for me. After countless phone screenings, resume drops, two separate interview days in California, I finally landed at <a href="http://www.dynamicsignal.com" target="_blank">Dynamic Signal</a> as a software engineer.

<h2>The Result</h2>

On my first day at DySi, I made some quip about Node.js, at WMP this would have resulted in some chuckles and "reinventing the wheel" remarks, but within a minute one of our other backend engineers explained that he had just gone to a conference and rattled off some specific benefits of the framework. Caught off-guard, I felt incredibly stupid, but then I got really happy. Finally a culture that really valued being technical. I still feel that way after a few months of working here, and I am really happy I made the move.

However, moving to San Francisco and transitioning to a startup has had some interesting twists and turns that might be worth mentioning:

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Renting to/in San Francisco is Hard</strong><br/>
The San Francisco rental market is insanely expensive and supply-constrained, and searching for a place to live here can be nerve-racking. Craigslist is the de facto tool for apartment searching, and now that PadMapper has been killed, you're stuck with that awful UI. Make sure you plan ahead and can buffer yourself for moving expenses and temporary expenses. <br/>
That being said SF is awesome and the ideal place for the crazy, the weird, the quirky, the outdoorsy, even the brogrammer.
<br/>

<li>
<strong>Silicon Valley is Like Hollywood for Engineers</strong><br/>
A friend of mine compared Hollywood and Silicon Valley, and I found his explanation very intuitive. Like actors, startup engineers here are hoping for that one big break that might never come. Some colleagues have worked at startups that have repeatedly failed, leaving them with no equity to speak of. The downside of this, of course, is that in SF if you're a programmer, you're really not that special.
<br/>
</li> 
<li>
<strong>Equity Might Be Meaningless</strong><br/>
It's almost as if equity, at this point, is just table-steaks needed to hire an engineer here. It really only matters if you IPO or sell, and it is highly rare that as an engineer that you will retire early because of it. Most engineers I have met appear to live comfortable lives, but few are splendidly rich. I'm not saying that it isn't nice to have, but it's something you learn not to expect coming to fruition.  
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Failure is Ok</strong><br/>
The culture of the Valley is try, fail, and then repeat until you get it right. You have to enjoy that to keep working at startups.
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Advancement is Ambiguous</strong><br/>
Coming from a company culture of metrics, goals, and annual reviews, it was bit of culture shock joining a startup. Titles rarely matter, and cultures are generally very flat. Promotions are not really on your minds, keeping the product alive is what drives you.
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Agile, but A La Carte</strong><br/>
In the consulting world, Agile and LEAN methodologies have become almost like a religion, a holy grail that experts and firms offer as expertise. A startup is rarely dogmatic about their implementation (we have a daily scrum, but our size doesn't necessitate an Agile planning game). It will pick and choose what it feels is helpful and relevant to building the product. In general, the most constant behavior I can observe is that as an engineer and as a company you have to flexible and adjust to priorities quickly.
<br/>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
While my time thus far in the startup scene has been very limited, I do feel satisfied that I made the right choice. Consulting exposed to me to different industries and helped me to grow quickly, at a very early stage of my career. I learned a lot and made some great friends along the way, all while in one of the best cities in the US: Chicago. However, the transition to a startup was ultimately the right choice for me and I think it's one of the more exciting avenues for people who want to continue developing their engineering skills. In time that may change, because the downside of working at a startup is that the endeavor is ultimately a gamble. Many, many startups fail leaving the participants without a job and without any equity. Fortunately, the demand for software engineers in the Valley is insatiable and there many great established firms here as well. For now, I am excited to keep enjoying the ride. I have already learned so much in just two months and I can't wait to share some of it here.
