I am not first to say this: interviewing, for the most part sucks. It's like dating: it's time consuming, can be awkward, and rarely results in both parties being totally satisfied. You comb through many candidates hoping to find that perfect match. What's worse is that, it's a very subjective experience. Interviewers can walk away with completely different opinions of the candidate, and visa versa.

Finding the right person for any job is hard, but its especially true for tech startups. We're looking for the right person, yesterday.

Prefer Generalist over Specialist

Principles are Principles

Attitude is Important

Forget about the Framework Candidate


Recruiters Should be Judged on Quality
