While I was working at West Monroe Partners I put together this <a href="http://jared-jenkins.com/rest-presentation">presentation on RESTful services</a>, and finally got the chance to polish it up for my website. REST has become a prevalent architecture style in web applications and services. In my presentation, I try to illustrate where services started, how REST came to be, and some of it's benefits. I hope you find it informative.
